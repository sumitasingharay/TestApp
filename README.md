# JavaScript

JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular data type.
- **Event-Driven**: JavaScript is designed to handle events like user interactions, making it ideal for web applications.
- **Prototype-Based**: JavaScript uses prototypes for inheritance, allowing objects to share properties and methods.
- **Cross-Platform**: JavaScript runs on any device with a web browser, making it highly portable.

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Development**: Adding interactivity to websites (e.g., form validation, animations).
- **Server-Side Development**: Using environments like Node.js to build scalable server-side applications.
- **Game Development**: Creating browser-based games.
- **Mobile App Development**: Building cross-platform mobile apps using frameworks like React Native.

## Example Code

```javascript
// A simple JavaScript function
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World")); // Output: Hello, World!
